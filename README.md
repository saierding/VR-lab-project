# VR-lab-project
Project Description: The project involves the design and implementation of an innovative solution for overcoming arachnophobia (fear of spiders) using a combination of VR experience and physiological sensor data. The outcome of the project is intended to be a working software and hardware setup that can be deployed at one of our partner institutions to run future studies on the use of VR in behavioural therapy
